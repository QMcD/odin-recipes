This is a odin project to help further develop my skills with HTML. For this project I will be creating a website that gives ingredients and instructions on how to make a few simple meals.

When I am done with this project. I will have a better understanding of HTML semantics and elements. I will know how to properly structure an HTML document. I will also know how to write a descriptive and accurate commit message.

Realizing that I need to make sure I save the file before I
add and commit. Also For the Garlic Parmesan a lot of files are popping up as added or changed that I don't want to. Currently my branches don't seem up to par.
