    <li>8 oz (250 g) brown mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>2 cups (500 ml) chicken broth, or stock</li>
    <li>
        1 1/2 cups (375 ml) heavy cream, divided (thickened

         used)
        </li>

    <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh chopped parsley, to garnish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>
        Heat half of the oil in a large pot over 
        medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs and 
        sear on both sides until golden brown and cooked 
        through. Remove chicken and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the remaining oil in the pot. Fry onion until 
        transparent, stirring occasionally (about 2 
        minutes). Saut√© the garlic until fragrant (30 
        seconds), then add in the white wine and allow to 
        reduce to half (about 4-5 minutes). Add the 
        mushrooms and cook for about a minute, while 
        stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour in broth and 1 cup of cream (or evaporated 
        milk); season with salt and pepper. Bring to a 
        gentle simmer then add the pasta. Mix well, reduce 
        the heat to a slow simmer while stirring 
        occasionally, until pasta is al dente (about 15 
        minutes).
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in the parmesan cheese until it melts through 
        the sauce. Remove from heat immediately and slowly 
        add in 1/4-1/2 cup remaining cream if sauce it too 
        thick for your liking. Adjust salt and pepper to 
        your taste.
    </li>
    <li>
        Slice the chicken into strips and stir through 
        the pasta. Garnish with fresh parsley and extra 
        parmesan, if desired
